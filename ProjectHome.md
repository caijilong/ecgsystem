An individual ECG acquisition system is proposed in this project which includes implementation of the ECG recorder, the detection of QRS complex, the HRV frequency analysis and the design of small-scale embedded system. The mixed signal processor (MSP) is used to reduce the complexity of an ECG recorder. To reduce the interference of 60Hz noise from the power line, the MSP is used to implement a finite impulse response (FIR) filter which is designed to be equiripple. The filter structure combines the pipe for the input samples and the symmetrical characteristic of the FIR filter for efficiently computing the convolution. This ECG signal is recorded for 24hr using a SD card. Furthermore, the ECG signal is transmitted to a smartphone and PC through Bluetooth to decrease the burden of this ECG recorder. In considering the performance of MSP430, the algorithm of detecting QRS complex is implemented using bit-shifting and FIFO data structure to increase detection speed, so that the detection of the real-time R fiducial point can be realized with MSP430. The unevenly sampling interval of RR sequence should be adjusted by interpolation and re-sampling. But this procedure causes the high frequency domain of RR sequence to be destroyed. Therefore, Lomb method is used to implement the frequency analysis of HRV. As the result of verification, show that the Lomb method is better than the conventional method. A time-triggered cooperative scheduler is added in this ECG recorder.
